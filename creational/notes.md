## Creational

* Handles object creational mechanics
* Solves the problem by controlling the creation process of an object
* Patterns
  * Constructor
    * Class-based
    * Functions that instantiate new objects with methods and properties
    * Common in JS
    * Create specific types of objects - preparation of object to be used
    * using the `new` keyword will tel function to behave like a constructor and instatiate a new object with the members
  * Factory
    * Class-based
    * Makes instance of several derived classes based on interefaced data or events
  * Abstract
    * Creates an instance of several families of classes without detailing concrete classes
  * Prototype
    * A fully initialize instance used for copying or cloning
  * Singleton
    * A class with only a single instance with global access point
  * Builder
    * Separates object construction from its representation; always creatse the same type of object
