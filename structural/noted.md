## Structural

* Class and object composition
* Structure or re-structure parts without affecting system
* Obtain new functionality with tampering with older ones
  * Less coupling
* Patterns
  * Adapter
    * Class-based / Object-based
    * Matches interfaces of different classes so classes can work together despite incompatible interfaces
  * Composite
    * A structure of simple and composite objects that makes the total object more than just the sum of its parts
  * Bridge
    * Separates an object's interface from its implementation so the two can vary independently
  * Decorator
    * Dynamically adds alternate processing to objects
  * Facade
    * A single class that hides the complexity of an entire subsystem
  * Flyweight
    * A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing of informatino that is contained elsewhere
  * Proxy
    * A placeholder object representing the true object
