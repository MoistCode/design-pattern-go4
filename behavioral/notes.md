* Improve communication between dissimilar objects
* Patterns
  * Chain of Responsibility
    * A way of passing a request between a chain of objects to find the object that can handle the request
  * Command
    * A way to separate the execution of a command from its invoker
  * Iterator
    * Sequentially access the elements of a collection without knowing the inner workings of the collection
  * Interpretor
    * Class-based
    * A way to include language elements in an application to match the grammar of the intended language
  * Mediator
    * Defines simplified communication between classes to prevent a group of classes from referring explicitly to each other
  * Observer
    * A way of notifying change to a number of classes to ensure consistency between the classes
  * Memento
    * Captures an object's internal state to be able to restore to it later
  * State
    * Alters an object's behavor when its state changes
  * Strategy
    * Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class separating the selection from the implementation
  * Template
    * Class-based
    * Creates the shell of an algorithm in a method, then defers the exact steps to a subclass
  * Visitor
